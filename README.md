# Hello! I am cindrmon1899!

I am just a forked copy of [cindrmon](https://github.com/cindrmon), specifically designed to do Web Development Tasks, as I have different plans from my main account. 

For another odd reason, I used this repository to form my vscode-extension-pack, just to kill two birds with one stone.

If ya ever find this, good for you! Have a nice day, and keep doing what you're doing.

I do have a couple websites that I proudly own:

[My main Portfolio Site](https://me.cindrmon.blue) (work in progress)
[My Personal Blog](https://waterloos.cindrmon.blue) (work in progress)
[Sandbox One](https://sandbox.cindrmon.blue) (work in progress)
[Cats Generator App v1](https://cats-name-generator.herokuapp.com/)

...and I am constanly learning new things, and improving myself to make even better versions of these websites, and to just overall, be the best person I can be.

I might focus all my efforts here for the time being, and there will be a time and place for everything...

Tysm and have fun!
